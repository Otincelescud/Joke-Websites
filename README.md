### A Message about Kabosu (Doge)

**Kabosu (Japanese: かぼす) was a Shiba Inu Dog that lived from November 2 2005 until May 24 2024. She lived a great and long life, being the oldest Shiba Inu to ever exist. Most people know Kabosu from the Doge Meme, and now she will always be remembered whenever anybody posts that silly picture of Kabosu making that funny face. She will continue to make people laugh and bring happines to this world. Rest in Peace Kabosu <3 !**
